# Hateful Machine
I got bored so like any sane person, I wrote a Discord bot to play text to speech and mp3 files over my speaker from anyone from a Discord server.  
  
# Why?
not even I can fucking answer that  
  
# How do I also torture myself?
###### first of all why would you want that
1. get a bot token (if you're here you should 100% know how to do it)  
2. have node, discord.js, sox, curl, lame, espeak installed
3. put the token and your user id in bot.js in the places specified
4. run this god awful mistake
